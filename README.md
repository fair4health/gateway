## How to deploy

Compile and package the project with

```
mvn clean package
```

and execute

```
java -jar target/gateway.jar
```

It can also be run as:

```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Deploy the [Keycloak auth repo](https://github.com/AriHealth/keycloak-auth). Execute the following curl:
```
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8083/oauth/login" -H "accept: */*" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{ \"password\": \"string\", \"username\": \"string\"}"
```

It should redirect the post to `http://localhost:8081/login` and provide the following response:
```

  "status" : 401,
  "error" : "Unauthorized",
  "message" : "Unauthorised access to protected resource",
  "path" : "/login"
}
```

    LOGGING_FOLDER=
    LOGGING_MODE=

## Docker deployment

Build the image:

```
docker build -t health/calculator .
```

Simple deployment:

```
docker run --name calculator -d health/calculator
```

Logging can be also configured using `LOGGING_FOLDER` and sharing a volume (this is useful for example for [ELK](https://www.elastic.co/elk-stack) processing). The level of the logging can be configured with `LOGGING_MODE` (dev|prod):

```
docker run --name calculator -d -v /tmp/log/calculator:/log/calculator -e LOGGING_FOLDER=/log/test -e LOGGING_MODE=dev health/calculator
```
